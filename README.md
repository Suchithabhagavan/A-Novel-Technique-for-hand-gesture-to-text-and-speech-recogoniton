# A-Novel-Technique-for-hand-gesture-to-text-and-speech-recogoniton
This paper proposes a system for translating hand gestures into speech and text, enhancing communication for speech-impaired individuals. Using machine learning and computer vision, it analyzes hand movements captured via depth-sensing cameras and motion sensors, extracting features like shape, motion, and temporal patterns.
